    methods (Abstract)
        
        % REQUEST Convenience method to transact with a device.
        % reply = device.REQUEST(command, data);
        %
        % command - Message to send to the device. This is a byte for the
        %           binary protocol or a string for the ASCII protocol.
        % data    - Arguments for the command. In the binary protocol this
        %           is a single integer. In the ASCII protocol this can be
        %           the empty array, a number, a string, or an array of
        %           numbers or strings.
        %           
        % reply   - Response from the device. Type is either BinaryMessage
        %           or AsciiMessage.
        %
        % This method ignores timeouts and will block until a message
        % is received.
        %
        % See also Zaber.AsciiDevice.request, Zaber.BinaryDevice.request
        reply = request(obj, aCommand, aData)
        

        % GET Read a setting from the device.
        % value = device.get(setting)
        %
        % setting - Identifier for the setting to read. For the Binary
        %           protocol this is a number and for the ASCII protocol
        %           it's a name string. See the relevant Zaber protocol
        %           manual for values.
        % value   - Current value of the setting. The type depends on the
        %           protocol and the setting, but is usually numeric.
        %
        % The behavior of this method is protocol-specific, but generally
        % it will read and return a setting from the device. In the event
        % of a communication error, an error will be thrown. If
        % communication succeeds but the device returns an error response,
        % a warning will be printed and the empty array returned.

        % See also set

        % SET Write a value to a device setting.
        % result = device.set(setting, value)
        %
        % setting - Identifier for the setting to write. For the Binary
        %           protocol this is a number and for the ASCII protocol
        %           it's a name string. See the relevant Zaber protocol
        %           manual for values.
        % value   - New value of the setting. The type depends on the
        %           protocol and the setting, but is usually numeric.
        % result  - True if the write succeeded, or the reply message if
        %           the device returned an error response.
        %
        % The behavior of this method is protocol-specific, but generally
        % it will attempt to change the value of a seting on the device.
        % Errors will be thrown if there is a communication error. If the
        % setting does not exist, the setting is read-only, or if the
        % value provided is out of range for the setting (ie if the device
        % returns an error response) then a warning will be printed and
        % the device's response message will be returned.

        result = set(obj, aSetting, aValue)
        
        
        % GETRANGE Determine the movement limits of the device.
        % range = device.GETRANGE();
        %
        % range - A 1x2 matrix with the first entry being the lower bound
        %         on legal device position and the second entry being the
        %         upper bound. Empty array of the concept doesn't apply.
        %         For a multi-axis controller the result will be an Nx2
        %         array where N is the number of axes. For rotary devices
        %         the range will be one full rotation. In all cases the
        %         device can be configured to have a restricted range of
        %         movement, and in that situation the user-configured range
        %         will be returned.
        %
        % Reads device settings to determine the device's current idea of
        % its range of movement. Returns the empty array if the concept
        % does not apply to the device type.

        %
        % interval - Optional; number of seconds to wait between checks
        %            of the device's state. Defaults to 0.1 seconds.
        % error    - Return value, normally empty. If the device
        %            entered an error state while this method was

        %            error message.

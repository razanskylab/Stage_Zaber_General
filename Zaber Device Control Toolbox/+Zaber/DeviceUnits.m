%   DEVICEUNITS Unit conversion helper for Zaber devices.
%   This class is used to store the unit scale factors for Zaber devices.
%   Unit conversions vary from device to device according to variations in
%   physical characteristics.
%
%   Note that for most devices, the device's resolutions setting must be
%   factored into the conversions. The scale properties found in this
%   class are typically measures of the number of device "steps" per
%   standard unit, but native device units are "microsteps" of which there
%   are "resolution" amount per step. So for example the native quantity
%   for position is the position scale times the number of meters times
%   the device resolution.

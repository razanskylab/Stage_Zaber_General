classdef (Abstract) Protocol < handle
%   PROTOCOL Base class for Protocols. Defines common functionality.
%   This is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated directly. Either
%   use Zaber.Protocol.detect(port) to attempt to automatically
%   instantiate the correct type, or if you know which type is correct
%   instantiate a Zaber.BinaryProtocol or Zaber.AsciiProtocol directly.

        % protocol = Zaber.Protocol.DETECT(port)
        %
        % port     - A configured and opened port to use.
        % protocol - An AsciiProtocol or BinaryProtocol instance,
        %            depending on which protocol was detected, or the
        %            empty array if detection failed.
        %
        % Given an open port, this function will try to determine
        % whether there are Zaber devices on that port using either the
        % Zaber Binary or Zaber ASCII protocols. If successful, it will
        % return a Zaber.Protocol object wrapping the given port. On
        % failure, it will return an empty array.
        %
        % If you are writing code that attempts to auto-detect Zaber
        % devices, this should be your first call. Once you have
        % detected the protocol, you can then use its finddevices()
        % method to initialize the actual devices.
        %
        % Note that this function does not alter the baud rate of the
        % serial port. If you are unsure what baud rate your devices are
        % set to, you will have to attempt detection at each likely
        % rate in higher-level code.
        %
        % If there are no responses from the serial port, this method
        % will block until the port times out. To change the timeout
        % period and suppress the timeout warning message, use:
        %   set(port, 'Timeout', 0.5)
        %   warning off MATLAB:serial:fread:unsuccessfulRead
        %
        % Note that if there are multiple daisy-chained devices that
        % have different protocol settings, the first one to respond
        % will determine the detection result here.
